# Lab3-8 Using MongoDB and MongoExpress
Learn how to integrate a database in Kubernetes.  You can clone this repository.  Then read "SECRETS.md" for an explaination on how to manage the database username. You will choose your own username and password, which you will encode base64.  After running your pipeline, you will open MongoExpress.   MogoExpress will run on your __LoadBalanced IP port :8081__. When Mongo-Express opens, you will use the username of "admin" and a password of "pass" to access it.

1) Start by reading SECRETS.md for an explaination on how to encode the database username and password.
2) Fork this repository.
3) View each file, and make changes where it is commented.  
4) Run your pipeline.
5) Demonstrate your changes to the code in your video, and show the resulting web page.  The webpage will be hosted at your loadbalanced IP.
